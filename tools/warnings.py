This is a beta version of scatter-fastboot.
It is not recommended to use this tool in production.
It only works with unlocked bootloaders.

This depends on a MediaTek build-env generated scatter file,
that can come from an SP Flash Tool package for your device.
Contact your OEM for details.\033[1;97m
